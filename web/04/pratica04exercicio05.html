                    <h2>What Not To Do</h2>
                    <p>If you've been wanting to learn a programming language to start off your career or just learn an additional language to broaden your skills here's what not to do.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't get stuck up on tutorials — I do think watching a course online can be handy and I will discuss this later, but don't spend endless hours on tutorials without anything practical. If you're just watching tutorials for the sake of it you might as well not watch them at all.</li>
                        <li>When you've started on the practical part, don't choose to do overwhelming projects. It can sound cool to create a complex app, but since you barely know anything about the language you should probably stick to the basics to begin with.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Things That You Should Do</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pick up a nice course on Udemy or any other learning platform that involves you to write code whilst going through the course itself so you can combine theory with actually writing code. I've been watching a couple of instructors I like for example and if want to learn something new I check if they have anything on the matter since I know that their courses have a lot of practice. There are also a lot of free resources on YouTube nowadays if you don't want to pay for courses.</li>
                        <li>Focus on the fundamentals concepts of the language itself. For example, I've been recently exploring Go and the language itself isn't OOP, although you can use objected-oriented patterns for structuring a program. But the main point is that every language is difficult and has its own purpose and specific. So if you're working on C#, but you want to learn Go you have to forget about C# specifics and not assume that something has to be in a certain way in Go, because it doesn't have to be , that's why it's a different language.</li>
                        <li>Since I've said a week, I'll assume that a course would usually take you a couple of days or slightly more, but let's say half of the week you're working on a course and the practical exercises it offers. After finishing with the course just go on Google and find a couple of simple project ideas that you can create to help you get a good feeling of the language. Usually the simple projects have a bit of everything to teach you and even if you'll end up working on a massive project it's also going to be made of small pieces(or it should) so as we said — don't overwhelm yourself with complex project from the get-go.</li>
                        <li>Open-Source is your friend. I've mentioned that I recently started learning Go myself. One thing that seemed really helpful is to find a couple of open-sourced projects, pull the codebase and just play around with the software. Look at the folder structure, the flow from hitting the API to the database, maybe even tweak it a bit and see what happens. It's really good to see how other people right code and for me at least it's really helpful to see how a project works from start to finish.</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Learning a new programming language doesn't have to be difficult, but we often tend to watch too many tutorials and write too little code. Watching tutorials in moderation combined with actually writing code is great though and you'll find that when you actually start typing the code you'll get even more motivated, especially when something breaks and the problem-solver in you wants to fix it. So just start of with the basics and don't rush out of them as the fundamentals are usually the most important, yet people often forget about them.</p>
